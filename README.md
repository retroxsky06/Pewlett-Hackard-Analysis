# Preparing for the Silver Tsunami
###### Challenge 7 Assignment

## Overview of the Project
As Baby boomers are retring at an accelerated rate (Silver Tsunami), the fictional company, Pewlett Hackard is preparing for its impact. To prepare for the upcoming retirements, the company is considering a mentorship program that will utilize their current work force, and who will train future generations. The purpose of this analysis is to assist Pewlett Hackard in identifying the number of potential retiring employees by their job title and mentors. The analysis is driven by two primary questions: 
1) Who is retiring?
2) How many roles will need to be filled from the impact of the "Silver Tsunami?" 

### Software 
- PostGreSQL 11.1
- pgAdmin 4.4

## Results
The table below reveals the number of retirement age employees who were born between January 1, 1952 to December 31, 1955, grouped by the title at Pewlett Hackard.

### Result Findings
- A total of 90,398 employees are near or at retirment age.
- The most impacted positions are "Senior Engineer" and "Senior Staff."
- Two managers are near or at retirement age, which is significant as there are only a total of nine current managers.
- 1,549 employees who were born between January 1, 1965 to December 31, 1965 are eligible to participate as mentors in the mentorship program. 


## Summary
Provide high-level responses to the following questions, then provide two additional queries or tables that may provide more insight into the upcoming "silver tsunami."
